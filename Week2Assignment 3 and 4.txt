Prompt 
Instruction: Generate test data for credit card applications across different types of cards and applicant conditions, structured.
Context: We are building a QA test data suite for a banking/financial services platform. 
The system must handle applications for Classic, Gold, Platinum, Student, and Corporate cards. Applicants may have varying profiles such as strong credit history, low credit score, underage, no credit history, duplicate requests, or exceeding credit limits.
Example: Inputs: Applicant age 25, income ₹8,00,000, credit score 780, requested card type: Platinum Conditions: Applicant meets eligibility criteria for Platinum (age > 21, income > ₹5,00,000, score > 750) Expected: Application approved Processing: System validates age, income, score, card eligibility Output: "Approved – Platinum Card issued" Tools: Test data simulator, DB seeding utility
Persona: You are an expert Test Data Management Architect with deep knowledge in financial services testing, credit card systems, and enterprise-grade QA practices.
Output:covering normal, boundary, and negative scenarios. Each test case should include realistic applicant details, eligibility rules, processing logic, and expected results in Excel format. 
Tone: Clear, professional, structured, and instructional — suitable for QA/Test Automation teams preparing enterprise-ready test data.

How to use the data  \n\n| Step | Action |\n|------|--------|\n| **1** | Copy the **CSV tables** below into separate worksheets (or a single sheet with a “CardType” column). |\n| **2** | Import the CSV into your test‑data generator / DB‑seeding utility (e.g. **DBUnit**, **TestDataBuilder**, **Faker**, **Mockaroo**). |\n| **3** | Map each column to the corresponding field in the **application service API** or the **UI form**. |\n| **4** | Execute the test case – the automation framework should follow the **ProcessingSteps** column to verify that the system behaves exactly as described. |\n| **5** | Validate the **ExpectedResult** against the response (status code, DB row, outbound message, etc.). |\n\n> **Tip:** All numeric values are expressed in Indian Rupees (₹) and the credit‑score follows the FICO‑like 300‑850 range. Dates are shown as `YYYY‑MM‑DD`.  \n\n---  \n\n### 2. Test‑case catalogue (CSV format)\n\n> **Columns** (in order)  \n\n| Col | Description |\n|-----|-------------|\n| **TC_ID** | Unique identifier (e.g., `TC_CL_001`). |\n| **Card_Type** | One of `Classic`, `Gold`, `Platinum`, `Student`, `Corporate`. |\n| **Applicant_Age** | Age in years (integer). |\n| **Applicant_DOB** | Date of birth (used for age validation). |\n| **Annual_Income** | Gross yearly income (₹). |\n| **Credit_Score** | Current credit‑score (300‑850). |\n| **Employment_Status** | `Employed`, `Self‑Employed`, `Student`, `Unemployed`, `Retired`. |\n| **Existing_Cards** | Number of active cards the applicant already holds (0‑5). |\n| **Requested_Limit** | Credit limit the applicant requests (₹). |\n| **Eligibility_Rules** | Brief rule summary that the system must evaluate (derived from business policy). |\n| **Processing_Steps** | Ordered actions the system performs – useful for logs / assertions. |\n| **Expected_Result** | Exact text that must appear in the response / UI (`Approved – <Card>`, `Rejected – <Reason>`). |\n| **Remarks** | Boundary note, negative‑test flag, data‑generation hint, etc. |\n\n---  \n\n#### 2.1 Classic Card – Core, Boundary &

Checklist for QA Teams  \n\n| ✅ | Item |\n|---|------|\n| 1 | All **boundary values** (minimum age, minimum income, minimum score) are covered. |\n| 2 | Every **negative path** (under‑age, low score, excess limit, duplicate, card‑count violation) has at least one test case. |\n| 3 | **Positive edge** cases (exactly on the threshold) are present for each card type. |\n| 4 | **Special personas** – retired, self‑employed, unemployed, student, corporate – are represented. |\n| 5 | **Duplicate‑request** detection logic is exercised (Classic & Student). |\n| 6 | **Multiple‑card** limits (max active cards, premium‑card caps) are validated. |\n| 7 | **Data‑generation hints** (`Employment_Status`, `Existing_Cards`, `Requested_Limit`) are explicit for synthetic data tools. |\n| 8 | The **Eligibility_Rules** column mirrors the exact business rule that should be asserted in the test script. |\n| 9 | **Processing_Steps** provide a deterministic order for log‑verification or mock‑service expectations. |\n| 10| **Remarks** give quick insight into why the case is important (boundary, negative, special condition). |\n\n---  \n\n### 5. Extending the suite  \n\n| What to add | How |\n|-------------|-----|\n| **International cards** (e.g., Visa Infinite) | Clone an existing premium row, change `Card_Type` and adjust income/score thresholds. |\n| **Dynamic income sources** (e.g., variable commission) | Add a column `Income_Source` and create rows with `Commission`, `Rental`, `Pension`. |\n| **Fraud‑risk flag** | Add a Boolean column `High_Risk_Indicator` and create a scenario where the system must reject despite meeting eligibility. |\n| **Multi‑currency** | Add `Currency` column, convert income/limits, and test currency‑conversion service. |\n| **API versioning** | Add `API_Version` column; duplicate each row for v1/v2 to confirm backward compatibility. |\n\n---  \n\n**End of document** – you now have a complete, export‑ready test‑data catalogue covering normal, boundary, and negative flows for every card product in the portfolio. Use it to seed your test environment, drive automated UI/API tests, and verify that the credit‑card application engine enforces all business rules correctly.",
                "reasoning": "We need to produce test data in Excel format (maybe as a table representation). Provide normal, boundary, negative scenarios for each card type. Include columns: TestCaseID, CardType, ApplicantAge, Income, CreditScore, EmploymentStatus, ExistingCards, RequestAmount, EligibilityCriteria, ProcessingSteps, ExpectedResult, Remarks. Provide a few cases per card type. Also mention how to generate via DB seeding etc. Should be clear. Provide as CSV representation that can be imported into Excel. Also maybe a separate sheet description. We'll output in markdown with tables. Provide guidance."
